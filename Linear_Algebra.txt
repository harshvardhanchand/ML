Column space of A/All Combinations of colums
A=[1 4 5;3 2 5;2 1 3] X=[x1;x2;x3]
C(A) = All vectors Ax =all linear combinations of columns
The column space is in a plane as two lines meet at a point and space between them gives us a plane
i.e C2 = C1+C3 ,it is dependent hence row rank =2
A full set of independent rows or columns are called basis
A =CR,column rank = row rank let r be rank implies r columns of C are independent
C(A) = C1*[1;3;2] + C2*[4;2;1] + C3*[5;5;3] Ci belongs to R
The nullspace of any Matrix A consists of all matrices B such that AB=0 and B is not zero
Nullity is defiend as number of vectors in nullspace
Every x in nullspace of A is orthogonal to column space of A 
every y in nullspace of A^T is orthogonal to row space of A
Bigger picture of linear algebra:two subspace in Rn and two in Rm(one nullspace and row/column space)
Usually way of multiplying matrices is row-column for high level maths we use column-row
A=LU (any matrix A can be represented as a product of lower triangular and upper triangular matrices)
orthogonal-vectors QT.Q=I  ,Q.QT#I
A=QR(A consists of independent columns)(columns in Q are orthonormal)
Gram-Schmidt(orthogonalization of columns of A)
Application of A=QR(least square problem)
Av =Lambda(v) eigen vectors are vectors which stretch/compress vectors without changing their directions
